# Hey, I'm [Your Name] 👋

> **IT Infrastructure & Cloud Security Specialist** — securing systems, architecting resilience, and automating everything in between.

---

## 🛡️ Security Focus

- **Security Architecture & Threat Modeling** — designing systems with security baked in, not bolted on
- **Risk Management & GRC** — governance, compliance, and risk frameworks that actually make sense
- **Cloud Security Governance** — policy, posture, and guardrails for cloud-native environments
- **AI Guardrails** — building responsible boundaries around AI systems
- **Vulnerability Management** — finding and fixing before the bad guys do

---

## 🖥️ Infrastructure & Systems

- System & network administration across hybrid environments
- Virtualisation, containers, and cloud platforms
- Comfortable in **Linux** and **Windows** — whichever gets the job done
- Strong mental model of how systems actually work, end to end

---

## 🤖 Automation & AI

- **Vibe coding** — pragmatic, AI-assisted development
- **AI prompt engineering** — getting the most out of LLMs for real-world tasks
- Automation-first mindset across infra and security workflows

## 📐 Docs as Code

I treat documentation like infrastructure — versioned, structured, and maintainable.  
Diagrams live in code. Runbooks live in repos.
